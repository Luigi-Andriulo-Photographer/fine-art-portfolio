# The Yellow Guardian of the Sea | Fine Art Print

## Artwork Concept
"The Yellow Guardian of the Sea" explores the concept of the "border" through color and repetition. The weathered texture of the wooden fence serves as a rhythmic foreground that slices the landscape into vertical segments, contrasting with the vast, fluid horizontal of the sea. The presence of sailboats on the horizon adds a layer of depth and narrative to the geometric stillness.
