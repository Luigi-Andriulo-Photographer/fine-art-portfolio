# Luigi Andriulo | Fine Art Photography

Welcome to my professional metadata and collection repository. I am a photographer specializing in coastal minimalism, maritime abstraction, and the "fragile geometry" of the Mediterranean world.

## Artist Vision
My work explores the intersection of silence, light, and the physical traces of human labor along the coasts. Each photograph is designed to function as a standalone statement piece or as part of a curated gallery wall for contemporary interiors and professional studios.
