"Industrial Fossil" is an exploration of the Anthropocene—the era where human-made materials and natural life intertwine. Captured at the small port of Rio Martino, this work focuses on a discarded tire that spent years submerged. The white calcified structures (Serpulidae) create an accidental masterpiece of "organic calligraphy" over the decaying rubber, symbolizing nature's resilience and its ability to re-appropriate industrial waste.
