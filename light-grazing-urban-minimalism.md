## Artwork Concept
"Light grazing in my hair" is a study of monumentalism and personal reflection. The photograph captures the stark contrast between the immense, cold steel of a naval vessel (F 597) and the warm, delicate detail of sunlight catching a person's hair. It explores the feeling of "waiting" and the silence found in busy industrial environments.

- **Composition:** Asymmetric, focusing on scale and light textures.
- **Color Palette:** Steel Grey, Warm Golden Sunlight, Terracotta accents.
