# Moai of the Shore | Fine Art Print

**Artist:** Luigi Andriulo

## Artwork Concept
"Moai of the Shore" is a photographic exploration of "Pareidolia" and Brutalist aesthetics within a natural context. The discarded concrete blocks, with their hollow geometric shapes, evoke the monumental presence of ancient statues (Moai) emerging from the sand. The work reflects on the permanence of industrial materials versus the ephemeral nature of coastal tides and wind-sculpted dunes.

- **Color Palette:** Cement Grey, Sand Beige, Deep Shadows.
