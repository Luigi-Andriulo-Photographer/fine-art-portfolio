It explores the tension between safety (the buoy) and the mysterious depths of the subconscious, represented by the liquid abstraction.

- **Color Palette:** Deep Crimson, Dark Teal, Slate Grey.
- **Ideal Placement:** High-end residential interiors, executive offices, or spaces designed for deep contemplation and emotional impact.
