# Abstraction in Motion | Fine Art Print

**Artist:** Luigi Andriulo  
**Series:** Mediterranean Silence  
**Theme:** Negative Space & Human Scale

## Artwork Concept
"Abstraction in Motion" utilizes extreme architectural framing to create a "letterbox" view of a serene coastal moment. By obscuring the majority of the frame with out-of-focus foreground elements, the viewer's attention is forced onto the solitary figure navigating the shallow waters. The work is a study on the beauty of the unseen and the importance of focus in a chaotic world.

## Visual Narrative for Designers
- **Visual Style:** Minimalist / Cinematic / Zen.
- **Color Palette:** Soft Blue, Sand, Warm Shadows.
- **Ideal Placement:** Perfect for narrow spaces or as part of a high-contrast gallery wall where negative space is required to create balance.
